## This is my submission to STAT545 hw1.


## Brief Intro
Hello everyone. My name is Ke Rang. You can call me Yuki. I'm an MEng student in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

I have encountered several requirements related to data visualization during my previous web development practices. Thus I wish to learn how to handle data in a "systematic" way. And that's why I'm here!
